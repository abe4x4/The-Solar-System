# The-Solar-System
- The Solar System Project is an informative site about our solar system (The Sun, the Moon, 8 planets, Pluto and some info about space exploration).
- My plan is to include the following reqired features:
1. Mobile first responsive website with 3 media queries (one for tablets, one for laptop and one for large monitor for desktop computers)2. A hamburger menu that is replaced by a navigation menu for larger screen.
3. email submission form that stores users info in a JSON file and displayes a confirmation message to the user
4. A video player with controls to play an informative clip about the solar system

 a README file that explains the following:
A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is.
Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements.
If needed, any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project.
The readme should be called readme.md or readme.txt and located in the top level of your project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when viewing your project on GitHub
