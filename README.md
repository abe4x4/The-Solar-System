I know that my project is very far from ideal but it stillsatisfy all the requierments I hope

I am trying to add as many requiered items as I can to exceed the project minimum requierements in case one or more are not accepted so my project hopefully still can pass.
Here are the items my project includes so far:

1. 3 Media Queries (they are in 3 separate css files with names that reflect their screen resolution targets)
2. Copyright update using js
3. Registration form using js
4. Hamburger Menu using CSS and JS
7. Flex Box layout (I tried the grid css in some later version of my project but it went out of control, I am sure I need more reading and I am hoping to implement the grid css in future versions from my site)
8. Mobile first responsive website
9. Multiple github interactions:
   a. (pull/push) using several different computers to work on the project
   b. Creating multiple branches
   c. Several commits and pushes
10. Readme file
11. will try to add bootstrap if I have time
12. nth of type (not set up after the recent project overhaul but was working before)
13. Video Player ( I had to take it off because it was messing up my layout, I am sure I will get it to work in the future before I include the website as my first project in my portfolio )
I directed all the links (except the registration form) to a page I named lorem,html to show that all the links are working
Thank you so much for your help and guidance. God bless you all
